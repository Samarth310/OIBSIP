Explanation of Nmap Scan Results (nmap -sS 192.168.1.16)

1. Command Used:
   nmap -sS 192.168.1.16
   - '-sS' specifies a TCP SYN scan (also known as half-open scan). 
     Nmap sends SYN packets to detect open ports without completing 
     the full TCP handshake.

2. Host Status:
   Host is up (0.062s latency).
   - The host 192.168.1.16 is online and reachable with a round-trip 
     latency of ~0.06 seconds.

3. Port Scan Results:
   All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.16 are in ignored states.
   Not shown: 1000 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
   - Nmap scanned its default 1000 common TCP ports.
   - All ports are reported as "filtered".
   - "Filtered" means no response was received. This usually indicates:
       a) A firewall is blocking the probes.
       b) Packet filtering rules are in place (e.g., Windows Firewall, iptables).
       c) An IDS/IPS or network device is dropping packets.
   - Because of filtering, Nmap cannot confirm whether the ports are open or closed.

4. Summary:
   - The target host is alive but not responding on any of the 1000 
     common TCP ports scanned.
   - Most likely explanations:
       • Firewall is enabled on the target.
       • No services are running on those ports.
       • Network filtering between scanner and host.

5. Next Steps:
   - Scan all 65535 ports: nmap -sS -p- 192.168.1.16
   - Run version detection: nmap -sS -sV 192.168.1.16
   - Try OS detection: nmap -sS -O 192.168.1.16
   - If firewall suspected, force scan without host discovery: 
     nmap -sS -Pn 192.168.1.16

Conclusion:
The host 192.168.1.16 is online, but all scanned ports appear filtered, 
suggesting firewall or filtering rules are blocking access.
